# Futurama quote

  **Steve Castle**: Listen, big guy, now that you're my protégé, it's time I cut you in on the secret to success. Any guesses?

  **Fry**: Uh, work really, really hard?

  **Steve Castle**: No.

  **Fry**: Oh, thank God!

  **Steve Castle**: It's all about appearances. That's why it's time to update our company's stodgy image and give it the sleek, dazzling veneer of the 1980's!
