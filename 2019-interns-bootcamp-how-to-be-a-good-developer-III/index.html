# Soft skills > hard skills

* Soft skills are hard: you can't learn them easily.

* Can you present your work?

* Everything's changing.

* Collaboration: you can't do everything on your own.

* Keep learning.

???

  yourself and collaborating with others.

 * Blog

???

# English

 * I strongly advise you to learn English.
 * I advise you to *speak* English.

???

 * Watch TV series in English (English subs if needed).
 * Read English content.
 * Write in English.
 * Play games in English.
 * Set language on your devices to English.

---

# Last but not least

* Conferences and meetups are good to meet new people.
* It's always a good idea to present your work (e.g. defend your thesis).
* Experience is everything.
* Don't expect to learn everything in school.
* Automating tasks saves time and is fun.

???

* E.g. to get a senior promote, the technical expertise is probably the less signifficant
  * And probably the promotion committee doesn't care about your code.
  * But coding is required to get the right skills, though.
* No one will call you a good dev if you are working on bullshit or no one knows about you.
* Be the face of your school project. Lead the project.
* Not just about writing code, also review PRs, respond to issues, help with testing, ...
* Deploy the blog first! Write about your experience.
* Theory in school vs. practical in a real job. Tell own experience.
  * What's valuable from school? Security, linux/unix/windows labs, math, algorithms, project management.
* Twitter is good.

# Futurama quote

  **Steve Castle**: Listen, big guy, now that you're my protégé, it's time I cut you in on the secret to success. Any guesses?

  **Fry**: Uh, work really, really hard?

  **Steve Castle**: No.

  **Fry**: Oh, thank God!

  **Steve Castle**: It's all about appearances. That's why it's time to update our company's stodgy image and give it the sleek, dazzling veneer of the 1980's!
