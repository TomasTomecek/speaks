# Agenda for today

* Intro to the project
* What we've achieved so far?
* Any challenges?
* Future plans

---
# Intro to the project

* A GitHub app which helps you integrate your upstream project into Fedora OS and CentOS Stream.

* TODO: add a picture

---
# What we've achieved so far?

* You can enjoy a platform to integrate with Fedora and CentOS Stream.

* Packit will help you with dependency problems while you work on the code.

???

* dep problems - no multi repo deps

---
# How's the project doing?
* 7 git repositories, 9 openshift pods, thousands of yaml, 9 people


* We release early and deploy often.
* We've automated our deployment process like mad.
* We have outages.
* We're helping people to get on-board of packit train.


---
# How do we develop packit?

--

* Like mad.

--

* Code review & pre-commit.
* Scrum-ish development process.
* Staging environment = continuous deployment & monitoring.
* Different sets of tests.

???

* unit, integration, functional, e2e, requre, x-repo

---
# Any challenges?
* Infrastructure is on cluster-fire.
* Too many requests.
* Upstream projects use different dev process.
* RPM spec files are hard.
* Running a service is not easy.
  * Security, operation, development
* User experience

---
# What's the future?
* Depends on what you want :)
* And what our leadership wants :D
* Complete the Fedora RPM release automation.

---
# Workshop!
## Saturday ...

---

# Thank you!
