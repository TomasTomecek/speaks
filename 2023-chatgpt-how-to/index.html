<blockquote>
You are an expert network engineer. I have a network connectivity problem on my
Fedora Linux laptop. All ping command invocations fail with "No route to host".
How can I troubleshoot this issue? Respond only with a short paragraph of text,
thank you.

# And a better answer

To troubleshoot the "No route to host" issue on your Fedora Linux laptop, follow these steps:

1. **Check Network Configuration**: Ensure your network settings, such as IP address, subnet mask, and gateway, are correctly configured. Use the `ifconfig` and `route -n` commands to verify.

2. **Ping Gateway**: Confirm that you can ping your router or gateway using its IP address. If this works, it indicates a problem beyond the local network.

3. **DNS Configuration**: Verify your DNS settings are correct. Try pinging a remote server using its IP address instead of hostname.

4. **Firewall Rules**: Check your firewall rules using `iptables` or `firewalld`. Ensure that they are not blocking ICMP packets (ping) or necessary ports.

5. **Network Service**: Ensure that the network service (`NetworkManager` or `systemd-networkd`) is running and managing your network interfaces properly.
