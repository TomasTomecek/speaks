# This is a work in progress

# Let's integrate your project into Red Hat's ecosystem
## RHEL, Fedora, open source, partners and contributors

## Stef Walter
## Tomas Tomecek

**This is only a temporary location, corporate theme will be added once the content is finished.**

---

# Introduction

* Stef Walter

* Tomas Tomecek

![Ecosystem](ecosystem.png)

---
# Why?

* Our partner and upstream projects are integrated together in a Linux distro.

* Neither partners nor upstream have immediate feedback on how rest of distro is affected.

--

* We all contribute back upstream individually.

* But the distribution itself is invisible in the workflow of those projects.

---
# Why?

* Partners and upstreams have to make significant effort to integrate downstream.

* It's tough to for you as a partner to figure out if you broke downstream.

--

* Let's be clear: packaging software is *not exciting*.

* Having latest greatest bits integrated with the rest.
  * That's exciting!

---

# Introducing Packit service

* Connect upstream projects with Red Hat's ecosystem.

* Build your upstream project for Fedora.

* Be informed right away that your change does not build in RHEL.

* Verify an upstream change in the ecosystem.

* Automated delivery.

* Available as an on-demand service or as a CLI tool.

# Meet packit service

TODO: add screenshot(s)
* Show the GitHub app.
* Show how it comments on a PR.
* Show the installation.

---

# The lab

* Use cases:

  1. Propose, build, deploy and validate a change to Fedora systemd.

  2. Build and deploy your upstream project as an RPM for RHEL.

TODO: Intro to RPM packaging?

TODO: Work backwards: show details after we proved the effect.

---

# Intro: Create a PR on systemd source-git.

TODO

---

# Requirements
  * packit config
  * spec file
  * Discussion: expectations: config file suggestions, web ui?

---

# Future

* What would you like to see in future?
* What features are missing right now?
* Should RPM packaging be easier?
