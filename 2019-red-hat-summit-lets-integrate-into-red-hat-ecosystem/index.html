# This is a work in progress

# Let's integrate your project into Red Hat's ecosystem
## RHEL, Fedora, open source, partners and contributors

## Stef Walter
## Tomas Tomecek

**This is only a temporary location, corporate theme will be added once the content is finished.**

---

# Introduction

* Stef Walter

* Tomas Tomecek

---

![Ecosystem](ecosystem.png)

---
# Why?

* Our partner and upstream projects are integrated together in a Linux distro.

* Neither partners nor upstream have immediate feedback on how rest of distro is affected.

--

* We all contribute back upstream individually.

* But the distribution itself is invisible in the workflow of those projects.

---
# Why?

* Partners and upstreams have to make significant effort to integrate downstream.

* It's tough to for you as a partner to figure out if you broke downstream.

--

* Let's be clear: packaging software is *not exciting*.

* Having latest greatest bits integrated with the rest.
  * That's exciting!

---

# Introducing Packit service

* Connect upstream projects with Red Hat's ecosystem.

* Build your upstream project for Fedora.

* Be informed right away that your change does not build in RHEL.

* Verify an upstream change in the ecosystem.

* Automated delivery.

* Available as an on-demand service or as a CLI tool.

---

# Meet packit service

TODO: add screenshot(s)
* Show the GitHub app.
* Show how it comments on a PR.
* Show the installation.

---

# The lab

* Use cases:

  1. Propose, build, deploy and validate a change to Fedora systemd.

  2. Build and deploy your upstream project as an RPM for RHEL.

---

# 1st task

    Our goal will be to submit a change for systemd in Fedora 29.

---

## Step 1

We'll start by looking at the systemd version we have in Fedora 29:

https://github.com/packit-service/systemd-source-git/tree/f29

TODO: update readme of systemd source-git: make it more user friendly and descriptive
---

## Step 2

Packit service is hooked into this repository and will build every patch we'll submit here.

---

## Step 3

Time to create the pull request!

TODO: what do we change?

---

## Step 4

Now we need wait for the packit service to create an RPM repository with a build of systemd using our change.

Any questions so far?

---

# How did we do this?
  * packit config
  * spec file
  * Discussion: expectations: config file suggestions, web ui?

---

# 2nd task

    Bring your upstream project into Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

---

## Step 1

Let's browse our application.

---

## Step 2

In order to utilize packit service, we need to add a spec file and packit.yaml

---

## Step 3

Build and test in a UBI 7 container.

---

# Future

* What would you like to see in future?
* What features are missing right now?
* Should RPM packaging be easier?
