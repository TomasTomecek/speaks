# From unit tests to daily validation jobs
## Tomas Tomecek
## Packit team

???
* ping sgallagh, he wants to join :)
* Intro: me
* Intro: Packit = Upstream CI system for RPM-packaged projects; TF = testing backend
* Fast presentation = let's discuss

---
# Above the code
<div class="middle center">

</div>

???

* Testing - being on top of our code
* ...with more code :D
* Freedom to do changes and have confidence they work without issues for us and our users
---
# Unit tests
<div class="middle center">
  <img src="p-s-unit-test.png" width=480 />
</div>

???

* Simple testing without external dependencies
* Those are mocked
* And not even being funny

---
# Integration
<div class="middle center">
  <img src="church.jpg" width=640 />
</div>

???
* We want to be sure that changes are nicely integrated with all the dependencies
* "More real"
* Can be expensive
* Database
* Testing our REST

---
# Integration [requre]
<div class="middle center">
  <img src="requre.png" />
</div>

???
* "Request recording"
* backstabbing python's import system

---
# requre [example]
<pre><code class="language-python">
class TestLocalProject(PackitTest):

    @requre.record_requests_module
    def test_checkout_pr(self):
        """Test PR checkout with and without merging"""
        project = LocalProject(git_project=self.project, pr_id=PR_ID)
        assert project.ref == f"pr/{PR_ID}"
        # check that HEAD of the merge matches HEAD of main
        main = project.git_repo.heads["main"]
        # 'Merge pull request #231 from packit/pre-commit-ci-update-config
        assert self.commit_title(project) == main.commit.message.split("\n", 1)[0]
        assert "koji_build" in (project.working_dir / ".packit.yaml").read_text()
</code></pre>

???
* No special treatment needed
* Network traffic is saved on-disk (secrets cleansed)
* It can record anything - whole git repos, or any function calls

???
* Continuous water stream which we try to drink from
* main branches are continuously built and deployed to stg
* This what the team uses to validate merged changes

---
# `hello-world`
<div class="middle center">
  <img src="hello-world.png" width=640 />
</div>

???
* a minimal RPM-packaged upstream project
* a functional, E2E place to test functionality for us
* errors are in sentry.io

---
# Daily validation jobs
<div class="middle center">
  <img src="breakfast.jpg" width=640 />
</div>

???
* Triggered every morning, as our breakfast
* A script can rerun easily from a CLI
* Putting it all together: sentry.io + E2E test cases + hello-world + stg
* If they fail, we are notified in sentry
* Both production and stg are validated
* Funny story: we've hit an issue recently of the uppoer limit for the number of commits in a PR
