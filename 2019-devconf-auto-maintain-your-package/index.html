# Who are Stef and Tomas?

---

# What's & Why's?

* Upstream projects make Linux distributions.

* Sadly, distros don't contribute back to upstream much.

* A new upstream release may easily break something downstream.

--

* Upstream projects have to make signifficant effort to integrate downstream.

* Let's be clear: packaging software is not *that* exciting.

* Having latest greatest bits integrated with the rest.
  * That's exciting!

# How would you like to know if your new upstream release works in Fedora 29 without doing anything?

---

# Development happens in upstream

* Keep working on the code until it's "good".

--

* CI is a development activity.

* Developers are responsible for the code to pass tests.

--

* You can use the tools you know.

* Benefit from the modern development techniques.

???

* Downstream has limited tooling, upstream has all the greatest stuff.
* git, github, make, $EDITOR
* keep working until all is green

---

# Auto-maintain, ehm?

* You take care of the content.

* We keep dist-git up to date.

* Package is still yours.

--

* We never land anything broken.

* You are doing decisions.

* Automation helps with mundane tasks.

* You can run the tooling locally.

???

* spec, patches, tarball
* spec can be upstream, or forked from upstream
* it's gonna be tough to sync the specs

# Packit

* The hardest thing was the name.

--

* Opens pull requests with new upstream releases.

--

* Brings feedback from downstream to upstream.

* Pull requests get downstream check results.

--

* Let anyone contribute easily.

* I can fork a package and deploy it.

???

* Tell upstream their newest release breaks rawhide or doesn't work with X.

* I can test a new upstream feature in Fedora or RHEL.

# Mockup

![Tests passed.](success-fedora-packaging-service.png)

---

# Rawhide gating

* We need rawhide to be stable!

* Let's gate on (at least) core packages.

* Everyone can contribute tests.

* Side tags.

* Workflow?

# How can you help?

* Feedback

* Become an early adopter

* Give us use-cases
