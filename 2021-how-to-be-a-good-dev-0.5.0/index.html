# `</body>`

* Don't expect to learn everything at school.

* Working in tech means to learn continuously.

* ...and face challanges.

???

* E.g. to get a senior promote, the technical expertise is probably the less signifficant
  * And probably the promotion committee doesn't care about your code.
  * But coding is required to get the right skills, though.
* No one will call you a good dev if you are working on a useless project or no one knows about you.
* Be the face of your school project. Lead the project.
* Not just about writing code, also review PRs, respond to issues, help with testing, ...
* Deploy the blog first! Write about your experience.
* Theory in school vs. practical in a real job. Tell own experience.
  * What's valuable from school? Security, linux/unix/windows labs, math, algorithms, project management.
* Twitter is good.

# Futurama quote

  **Steve Castle**: Listen, big guy, now that you're my protégé, it's time I cut you in on the secret to success. Any guesses?

  **Fry**: Uh, work really, really hard?

  **Steve Castle**: No.

  **Fry**: Oh, thank God!

  **Steve Castle**: It's all about appearances. That's why it's time to update our company's stodgy image and give it the sleek, dazzling veneer of the 1980's!
