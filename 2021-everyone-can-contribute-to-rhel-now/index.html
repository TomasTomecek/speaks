## How did contributions work for CentOS Linux in the past?

--

* They mostly didn't.

--

* CentOS Linux 8 and earlier is downstream to RHEL.
  * So all changes need to go through RHEL first.

* Occasionally people would send patches to RHEL Bugzilla.
  * Sometimes it took years to fix things.

* CentOS-specific changes were not possible.
  * Except for SIGs.

???

* The main reason being that CentOS Linux is downstream to RHEL.

* And some would never be fixed

# CentOS Stream 9 will be different...

---

# CentOS Stream 9

* Open Source development model.

* Upstream for RHEL 9.

* Will be available to be consumed and for contributions later this year.

* You can look at [Fedora ELN](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/eln/) in the meantime.

* CVEs and embargoed content will be private.

* Kernel development will be open completely.

---

# Continuous Integration & Delivery

* The contribution model is built around rigorous testing.

* Changes proposed to the Stream need to pass all checks!

* RHEL maintainers will use CentOS Stream 9 to develop RHEL 9.

* You can contribute tests if you care how certain features work.

* Continuously available.

* Reporting issues is a contribution as well.

---

# How do I contribute?

* All repositories will be hosted on GitLab.

* It will be as easy as opening a merge request.

* The contributions will go through the standard open source review process.

* Maintainers will decide what’s getting in.

* [Open a Bugzilla against the CentOS Stream version](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=Red%20Hat%20Enterprise%20Linux%208&version=CentOS%20Stream).

---

# CentOS Stream 8

* Available to be consumed right now!

* RHEL 8 is still the upstream.

* Contributions going through Red Hat Bugzilla still.

* It’s hard to course-correct along the way.
