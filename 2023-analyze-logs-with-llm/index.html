# The problem

???

In software engineering, we face a lot of logs. We are out the most avid readers out there.
When things break, we need to find a needle in the haystack to find out what went wrong.

We can hire people to read those logs.
If only there was a system that could read text, process it and provide sensible human feedback!

# GPT's answer

```
The root cause of the error is that there are undefined symbols in the source
code of the podman package during the RPM build process. Specifically, the
symbols portNum are undefined in the file pkg/specgen/generate/kube/kube.go.

To fix this error, you need to address the undefined symbols. Here's the likely
way to fix it:

Locate the source code for the podman package, which should be available in a
directory like /builddir/build/BUILD/podman-<version>.

Open the file pkg/specgen/generate/kube/kube.go mentioned in the error log.

Go to line 617, 619, and 621 in the file and check how the symbol portNum is
being used. It seems that portNum is not defined in the current scope, which is
causing the error.

Find the correct definition or import statement for portNum and add it to the
file kube.go. Make sure the definition or import statement is correct and
compatible with the rest of the codebase...
